//! FSK demodulation
//!
//! A demodulator for 2FSK, including Specific Area Message
//! Encoding (SAME). An output `sample < 0` indicates a space bit,
//! and an output `sample > 0` indicates a mark bit. A variety of
//! input sampling rates are supported.
//!
//! An external symbol synchronizer is required in order to select
//! the correct samples to demodulate.
//!
//! Demodulation relies on the "matched filter" approach described in
//!
//! * Campbell, Robert F., "Analysis of Various Algorithmic approaches
//!   to Software-Based 1200 Baud Audio Frequency Shift Keying
//!   Demodulation for APRS," master's thesis, June 2016,
//!   <https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2811&context=theses>,
//!   pp. 18 – 22.
//!
//! `multimon-ng` uses a correlator instead, but the overall technique
//! is similar. We use a complex matched filter to handle the case where
//! the transmitter's oscillator is 90° out of phase with our receiver
//! filters.

/// *message signal*. The message signal is recovered and
/// estimated.
///
/// New samples are loaded into the demodulator with
/// [`push()`](#method.push). At any time, execute
/// [`demod()`](#method.demod) to demodulate the samples
/// in the history buffer.
